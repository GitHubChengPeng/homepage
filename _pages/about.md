This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

## Biography

Peng Cheng is a lecturer in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Southwest University, China. 


He works broadly on the theoretical aspects of machine learning and algorithmic economics. Classically, the outcome of a learning algorithm is considered in isolation from the effects that it may have on the process that generates the data or the party who is interested in learning. In today's world, increasingly more people and organizations interact with learning systems, making it necessary to consider these effects. 

Addressing machine learning in this context calls for approaches that align the incentives and interests of the learners and other parties, are robust to the evolving social and economic needs, and promote equity. Prof. Haghtalab's work in machine learning, economics, and theory of computer science addresses emerging fields such as learning in economic and societal settings, collaborative learning, robustness of ML, fairness and privacy.

Previously, Peng was a post-doctoral researcher in the CS department of Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, in 2019-2020. Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Kansas Medical Center, USA, in 2016-2017. In 2016, he received Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. 

He is broadly interested in statistical machine learning, reliable machine learning (robustness, privacy, fairness, and et al.), evolutionary muti-objective optimization. 

Recently, his research has been focusing on fairness in machine learning, privacy preserving data mining, optimization in scheduling, and the applications of machine learning.
