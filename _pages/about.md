This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

## Biography

Peng Cheng is a lecturer in the Department of Computer and Information Science at Southwest University, China. 

Peng has conducted research focused on safeguarding privacy in the context of data mining. 
In contemporary society, there is a growing necessity to exchange a greater volume of data among individuals 
and institutions in order to attain advantages and generate financial gains, 
or to comply with regulatory requirements for public disclosure. 
Nevertheless, individuals often express concerns over the issue of privacy infringement. 
Peng's research centers on the prevention of the divulgence of confidential data.

Previously, Peng was a post-doctoral researcher in the CS department of Free University of Bozen-Bolzano in 2019-2020. During this time, Peng's research mostly revolved around the scheduling problem in construction and the utilization of constraint programming techniques. The modeling of construction scheduling was approached as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), with the subsequent development of solutions and tools utilizing constraint programming approaches for its resolution.

Prior to that, he was a postdoctoral researcher at University of Kansas Medical Center, USA, in 2016-2017. During this period, Peng conducted an investigation into illness predicting models that utilized supervised learning techniques applied to structural medical data.
In 2016, Peng received Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harbin Institute of Technology, China. 

Peng is broadly interested in statistical machine learning, evolutionary multi-objective optimization, and trustworthy machine learning (robustness, privacy, fairness, and et al.). 
His recent research has concentrated on privacy-preserving data mining, scheduling optimization, and fairness in machine learning.
